the Shell
create a shell that is able to launch one program at a time, with arguments, waiting for and reporting the exit status 

shell should :
		fork to create a new process ( which will run the command)
		set up any i/o redirection
		exec the program
		wait for and report the exit status
		report the real/user/system tim econsumed by then command (wait3)
	
we can parse stdin with "strtok"

command argument > output (redirection)

# is a comment line and is ignored


BUILT in COMMANDS:

built in "cd" - using the chdir systemcall

optionally insert a "pwd" built in command

"exit" command- which takes in a single argument (exit tbe shell)

---no need for i/o redirection for built-in commands


I/O redirection:
	
< filename : open filename and redirect stdin to the file

> filename : open/create/truncate filename and redirect stdout

2> filename: open/create/truncate filename and redirect stderr

>> filename: open/create/append filename and redirect stdout

2>> filename: open/create/append filename and redirecet stderr
